# How this design system works

Written for designers. No knowledge of the code assumed. Six short pages.

## The whole thing in a paragraph

> A component is described in two halves. The **code** already knows the mechanical things — what
> properties it takes, what values they accept, the defaults. The **contract** is a small file next
> to it holding what the code cannot say: what it really is, what it promises about accessibility,
> and which family of token is allowed to paint each part. Neither half is complete alone, and a
> tool merges them on demand. Writing something in the contract that the code already knows is
> treated as a mistake — **unless a check compares the two**, in which case it is allowed on
> purpose, because a contract that left out the settings could never be the thing you build from.

And the idea behind that: **you don't fix the output, you fix the system that produced it.**

## These pages explain. They don't decide.

Everywhere else in this repo, each fact lives in exactly one place and everything points at it
rather than restating it — that's what stops docs drifting.

These pages break that rule on purpose, because an explanation that refuses to restate anything is
useless. So: **if one of these ever disagrees with the technical doc it links to, the technical doc
is right and this one is stale.** Say so and we'll fix it.
